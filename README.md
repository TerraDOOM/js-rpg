A small RPG project i wanted to do for a while. i didn't really start working on it until my friend terra told me he wanted to help so now i'm working on it with him :D the main idea is to make somwhat of a engine that could be bend easely by other people but we migh just end up making a game togheter and publishing it for everyone to have fun with.
