A small RPG project i wanted to do for a while. i didn't really start working on it until my friend terra told me he wanted to help so now i'm working on it with him :D the main idea is to make somwhat of a engine that could be bend easely by other people but we migh just end up making a game togheter and publishing it for everyone to have fun with.


field of grass under the stars:
a small special event you can have acces to if you spend enough time in the forest its a small patch of land
with no trees and a killer view of the moon.
